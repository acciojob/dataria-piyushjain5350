# Dataria

## Instructions

In the ancient city of Dataria, two master blacksmiths, Emily and Oliver, had forges located on opposite sides of the city. They were known for creating the most exquisite metalwork in the realm. Each blacksmith had a record of the items they crafted, sorted by the date they were completed.
One day, the king called upon Emily and Oliver to create a special collection of weapons and armor for his personal guard. He asked them to combine their records and sort them in ascending order by completion date, so he could choose the best pieces for his collection.

Can you help Emily and Oliver write a function that merges their sorted records into a single sorted record of all the items they've crafted?

```
Input:
Two sorted arrays of integers, representing the completion dates of Emily's and Oliver's crafted items.
Output:
A new array containing the integers in ascending order, representing the combined and sorted completion dates of Emily's and Oliver's crafted items.
```

## Example

```
mergeCraftDates([3, 7, 12, 20], [1, 5, 8, 18, 25]); // Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 18, 20, 25]
```
